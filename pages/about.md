# **About Me**

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in the Psychology department at UW-Madison working with <a href="https://www.niedenthalemotionslab.com/">Paula Niedenthal</a>. I received my Ph.D. from the Psychological and Brain Sciences department at Dartmouth College, where I worked with <a href="http://www.wheatlab.com/">Thalia Wheatley</a>. 

Before beginning my graduate studies at Dartmouth, I received BAs in Music and Cognitive Science at the University of Virginia, where I worked with <a href="https://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/mk9y">Michael Kubovy</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lauramariegetz/">Laura Getz</a>. After I graduated, I was a post-baccalaureate research assistant at the National Institutes of Health working with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/alex-martin">Alex Martin</a>. 

# **About My Research**

My research aims to understand how nonverbal behaviors such as eye contact and facial expression can connect us to one another when interacting. Previously, I used eye-tracking to measure pupillary synchrony between two interacting people in order to investigate how we dynamically share and break attention with one another around moments of eye contact in conversation. My post-doctoral work aims to understand how similar dynamics might accompany naturally-occurring facial expressions. Specifically, I want to understand the typical facial expressions a person can expect to see in their daily social interactions, and I want to understand how the interplay of facial expressions between two interacting individuals can inform how perceptive they are when reading their partner’s emotional state.

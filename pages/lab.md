# **Introducing the UTK Social Coordination Lab**

I will be starting in fall of 2025 as an assistant professor in the psychology department at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. 

My lab will study how we manage to **coordinate** our behavior each other in ways that build deep and lasting social **connections**.



Most of life’s greatest moments—landing a dream job, learning something new, falling in love—begin with a single positive social interaction. Positive interactions can build deep relationships that mitigate feelings of loneliness and generate creative solutions beyond the reach of one mind alone. When they are happening, these interactions feel easy to us, like they are second nature. But if we look more closely, we see that social interation is actually an impressive feat of coordination. When people interact, they must coordinate a cascade of social cues—adapting, moment by moment, to each other’s words, facial expressions, body language, and actions—each of which may vary from culture-to-culture, or even person-to-person. When these adaptations go awry, they can do more than just preclude feelings of shared understanding, empathy, and connection. They might deter us from seeking out such interactions in the future. 

My research program investigates how we, as individuals and social beings, coordinate our behavior and physiology to produce positive social interactions. To answer this question, I link basic cognitive processes observed via rigorous, tightly controlled experimental paradigms with naturalistic studies of dyadic social interaction. My work also employs a range of computational methods, including natural language processing tools and unsupervised clustering methods. I have studied how we coordinate our attention with one another around instances of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2106645118">eye contact</a>, and I have also investigated how people differ in their tendency to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-29776-6">synchronize</a> their attention with other people. But, I'm not just interested in attention. I'm also working on building a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2024.2446945">database</a> of facial expressions that occur naturally during interaction and a model to understand and categorize them. And I'm not stopping there. I want to develop computationally sophisticated and integrative models of *all* coordinated behavior—facial expressions, attention, eye contact, body movement, speech, and more. My lab will endeavor to study all these building blocks of social interaction in order to understand the mechanism underlying how we form and maintain social connections.

<b>**PhD Students**
I will be recruiting students for fall of 2026! Reach out if you find the above description of my research interesting and are a person who finds joy and growth in the messiness/failure inherent in the learning process. Bonus points if you have similar interests that you'd like to explore together.
